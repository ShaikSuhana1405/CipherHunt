##  Project Purpose
CipherHunt allows users to:
- Solve cryptographic puzzles using Caesar, XOR, and Substitution ciphers.
- Explore step-by-step decryption explanations to understand how each cipher works.
- Practice cryptography in a fun, interactive, and educational way.
- Use a Free Decryptor mode for experimenting with custom ciphertexts.
